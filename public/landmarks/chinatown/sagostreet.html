<h1>Sago Street</h1>
<img src="../../assets/img/chinatown/sago street.JPG" alt="Sago Street"/>
<p>While this area may have gotten its name from the sago factories located here during the 1840s, it was more famous for the Chinese death houses that were along the neighbouring Sago Lane* .
<br>
<br>As most early immigrants were here without their family, the dying would come and live out their last days on the upper floors of the death house – while funerals were held right below, on the ground floor. Though it was known as “street of the dead”, 
it was anything but quiet. You would hear priests chanting scriptures, and see mourners burning paper effigies in huge bonfires. And the street was also teeming with food stalls that catered to visitors and mourners during the day and through the night.</p>
