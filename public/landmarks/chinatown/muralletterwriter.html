    <h1>Mural on letter writer @ Smith Street</h1>
<img src="../../assets/img/chinatown/Mural on letter writer.JPG" alt="Mural on letter writer"/>
<p>A Singaporean artist who practises different visual mediums like murals, canvas, sketches, installations, digital drawing, photography and video-making. Here, you will see more of my public murals because they are the most visible, 
being on the streets. I used to do art on a part-time basis from 2015 till 2018 while working in the accounting profession. 
In mid-2018, I left finance and have since spent much more time creating art.
