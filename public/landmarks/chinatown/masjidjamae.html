<h1>Masjid Jamae (Chulia)</h1>
<img src="../../assets/img/chinatown/masjid jamae.JPG" alt="Masjid Jamae(Chulia)"/>
<p>First established in 1826, the Masjid Jamae mosque is unique in many ways. As one of the oldest mosques in Singapore, it's also one of the only six in the country that regularly conducts sermons in Tamil.
<br>
<br>Designed by Irish architect George Coleman and completed in 1835, the mosque cleverly fuses architectural features from the
East and West together. Indo-Islamic motifs are paired with Tuscan pilasters, with accompanying Chinese green porcelain tiles.
<br>
<br>Walking in, visitors will quickly notice that the prayer room is
interestingly not aligned with the facade, but rather to Mecca. For a more in-depth experience, approach the mosque's Dawah Officer who will happily answer any questions about the building and even Islam in general.</p>
