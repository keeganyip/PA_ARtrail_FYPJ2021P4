<p>There are immersive audio tours and interactive exhibits to help you retrace the footsteps of migrants in the late 19th century. Back then, Chinatown was infamously filled with seedy brothels, squalid opium houses, illegal gambling dens and notorious secret societies.
<br>
<br>The Chinatown Heritage Centre is also the only place in Singapore where you’ll find the original interiors of its shophouse tenants in the 1950s. An actual tailor shop and the living quarters of Singapore’s early settlers have been authentically conserved to provide an intimate glimpse into their lives. Discover the personal stories of people who made this shophouse their home, and you’ll walk away with a better understanding of Singapore’s Chinatown.</p>
