<p>The Buddha Tooth Relic Temple & Museum is a Tang-style Chinese Buddhist Temple. The name is derived from what Buddhists regard as the left canine tooth of Buddha. Recovered from his funeral pyre in Kushinagar, India, it’s now displayed on its grounds. The sacred relic is housed in a giant stupa that weighs an amazing 3500 kilogrammes – made from 320 kilogrammes of gold, of which 234 kilogrammes were donated by devotees.
<br>
<br>There are weekly guided tours and talks to help you understand the religion and its teachings. Though the temple was built in 2007, its richly designed interiors and comprehensive exhibits tell stories of Buddhist culture over thousands of years old.</p>
