<p>Tong Heng is one of Singapore’s oldest confectioneries. The founder’s success is a story of resilience, determination and resourcefulness – the quintessential spirit of early Singapore. 
Though Fong Chee Heng arrived in 1901 as a coolie (unskilled labourer) from China, he managed to save enough funds for a pushcart to peddle coffee around Chinatown during the 1920s.
<br>
<br>By the 1930s, he had his own coffee shop at 33 Smith Street. Today, it’s in a bigger, revamped shop just across the road. Have a bite of the legendary egg tart, and you’ll see why the business is still going strong after more than 100 years.</p>
